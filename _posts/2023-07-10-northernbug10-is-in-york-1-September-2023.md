We are really excited to announce that the next NorthernBUG meeting is taking place in York on Frday 1st September 2023. [Registration is now open](https://northernbug.github.io/northernbug10)!

For this, our tenth meeting, we will be in the beautiful and historic setting of the York Guildhall, right in the centre of the city with views over the river. We will have our training/walkthrough style morning followed by lunch with posters, and then moving into an afternoon of research talks. Thanks to our sponsors we will be able to offer more prizes, and we have more Carer's Bursaries available too - just get in touch to ask.

We have lots of space for posters and discussion, and want to support all career stages with talks - so we look forward to your abstract submissions!

All details including a very preliminary programme and link to the registration form (with abstract submission in the same form) can be found on our [NorthernBUG10 meeting page](https://northernbug.github.io/northernbug10). Registration (and abstract submission) is open until **Thursday 10th August**.

Please email us with any questions, comments and suggestions at [andrew.mason@york.ac.uk](andrew.mason@york.ac.uk).

See you in September!
