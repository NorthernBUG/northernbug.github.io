There are also regular bus service to and from these two stations.

The meeting will include a talk from Dr Simon Cockell: 'Putting the "space" into spatial transcriptomics: Lessons from computational geography' and an optional morning Workshop: 'Basics of Multi-omics data: technologies and methods'.

Call for Speakers and Poster Presentations: We invite you to contribute to the success of this event by submitting your abstracts for talks [both short talk (20 minutes) and flash talks (5 minutes)] and poster presentations. We are friendly group and this will be an excellent opportunity to get feedback from other bioinformaticians about your research. We particularly welcome abstracts from people wishing to talk about real world bioinformatics issues, help problem solving with a project, or from those looking for feedback at the early stage of a project.
