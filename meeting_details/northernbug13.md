We are excited to announce the next Northern BUG meeting, which will be held on __Friday 20th September 2024__ at the Michael Smith Building in sunny Manchester. 

The Michael Smith Building is about a 15 minute walk from Oxford Road train station, and about a 30 minute walk from Piccadilly train station. There are regular bus services to and from the [train stations](https://www.tfgm.com/plan-a-journey).
 
# The meeting:
The event will include a keynote talk from _Prof. Karen Piper-Hanley: 'A multi-modal approach to define the patho-architecture and cell state transitions during human liver fibrosis'_, and there is an optional morning workshop _'Basics of Multi-omics data: technologies and methods'_.
 
# Call for speakers and poster presentations:
This event is for everyone. We invite you to contribute to its success by submitting your abstracts for talks (both short 20 minutes talks, and 5 minutes flash talks) and poster presentations.   
 
The BUG is a friendly community and this will be an excellent opportunity to get feedback from other bioinformaticians about your project. We particularly welcome abstracts from people wishing to: talk about real world bioinformatics issues; share methods; problem solve a project; or seeking feedback at the early stage of a project.
 
# Prizes:
To recognise exceptional contributions, we will award £100 for the best talk and the best poster presentations. Take this opportunity to share your work, you could be a winner!
 
# Limited Spaces:
Please note that spaces for this event are limited. Priority will be given to presenters and those who register early. Don't delay!
