# General

The organising committee for NorthernBUG15 is: Andrew Mason, Marcello Beltrami, Sally James and Alastair Droop. Emails should be directed to Andrew at andrew.mason@york.ac.uk

The meeting will take place on 23rd January 2026 in **The Department of Biology at The University of York**. Weather depending, it's a nice ~40 minute walk from the station to the university, or you can catch the [U1 or U2 buses](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/york/plan-journey/timetables) to [Wentworth Way bus stop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PKHJRNNRVXiSqSb47) in ~25 minutes. There is some limited [car parking on campus](https://www.york.ac.uk/about/transport-maps-parking/parking/) or you can use the [Park & Ride at Grimston Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N5WHQjnmiqkXTweA9).

# Registration

Registration has now closed.

# Travel scholarships

We have been supported by the UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst who will be providing up to 5 travel scholarships for the meeting! Please register and [then apply via this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGjgcBSc2E_mLy8yr6mxdJQuNVYGy_soVkbb1O1n2Iow_3yA/viewform). 

# Agenda

This is very much TBC - talks selected from submitted abstracts will be confirmed soon after the 9th January 2026 registration deadline. We intend to have a series of data organisation presentations and an open forum discussion in the morning before lunch, and then have the user group in the afternoon.
Posters and talks will be judged by all attendees using Google Forms, with prizes awarded for the top scoring.

If you have a suggestion you'd like us (or organisers of the next meeting) to take on board, let us know!.

# What to expect

NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research. Meetings are free, and lunch is provided!

These meetings focus on being a user group for the benefit of all. Talks and posters do not have to be a polished and complete body of work, but can be an opportunity to discuss your research with others experienced in the area. There is always a friendly atmosphere, with discussions around techniques, training and education, as well as broader applied research areas. 

We continue to be core supported by [The Genetics Society](https://genetics.org.uk/), but thanks also to our amazing sponsors past and present. For NorthernBUG15 we are supported by [Twist Bioscience](https://www.twistbioscience.com/) and [Azenta Life Sciences](https://www.azenta.com/). Event sponsors will have stalls on the day, so there is an opportunity to hear about new technologies, promotional sequencing offers, and the potential for jobs in industry. Thank you to all our sponsors!

# Feedback
We will open a feedback form at the close of the meeting which will remain open for 7 days.
All feedback is incredibly valuable for determining the direction of NorthernBUG, improving and keeping meetings relevant to members, and for sourcing future funding.
