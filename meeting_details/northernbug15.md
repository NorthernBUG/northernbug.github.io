# General

The organising committee for NorthernBUG15 is: Andrew Mason, Marcello Beltrami, Sally James and Alastair Droop. Emails should be directed to Andrew at andrew.mason@york.ac.uk

The meeting will take place on 23rd January 2026 in **The Department of Biology at The University of York**. Weather depending, it's a nice ~40 minute walk from the station to the university, or you can catch the [U1 or U2 buses](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/york/plan-journey/timetables) to [Wentworth Way bus stop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PKHJRNNRVXiSqSb47) in ~25 minutes. There is some limited [car parking on campus](https://www.york.ac.uk/about/transport-maps-parking/parking/) or you can use the [Park & Ride at Grimston Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N5WHQjnmiqkXTweA9).

# What to expect

NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research. Meetings are free, and lunch is provided!

These meetings focus on being a user group for the benefit of all. Talks and posters do not have to be a polished and complete body of work, but can be an opportunity to discuss your research with others experienced in the area. All speakers have been encouraged to leave 20% of their time for questions and discussion. There is always a friendly atmosphere, with discussions around techniques, training and education, as well as broader applied research areas. 

# Registration

Registration has now closed.

# Travel scholarships

Thank you for the support of the UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst in providing travel scholarships for this meeting. These have now closed and we will announce the winners shortly.

# Agenda

Posters and talks will be judged by all attendees using Google Forms, with prizes awarded for the top scoring.

If you have a suggestion you'd like us (or organisers of the next meeting) to take on board, let us know!

We will award Best and Runner Up prizes for talks and posters based on your votes! Please use the Google Form rating systems below.

# Our funders

We continue to be core supported by [The Genetics Society](https://genetics.org.uk/), but thanks also to our amazing sponsors past and present. For NorthernBUG15 we are supported by [Twist Bioscience](https://www.twistbioscience.com/) and [Genewiz by Azenta Life Sciences](https://www.azenta.com/). Event sponsors will have stalls on the day, so there is an opportunity to hear about new technologies, promotional sequencing offers, and the potential for jobs in industry. Thank you to all our sponsors!
