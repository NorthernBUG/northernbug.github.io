# General

THE organising committee for nothernBUG14 is Dr Jarek Bryk (nBUG part), Dr Martin Carr (YUEG part), Dr Maria Pala and Ophelia Forbes with members of the students' Bioscience Society. Emails should be directed to Jarek at j.bryk@hud.ac.uk.

This time we are trying something new - nBUG14 will be held jointly with a revival of the Yorkshire Universities Evolutionary Group (YUEG) meeting, the latter taking place for the first time since 2019! The order of the day will remain unchanged, except that there will be two parallel talks sessions, each more focused on the audience for nBUG or YUEG. During registration, you will have an option of choosing which group you fell more affiliated with (or both, as we suspect that many participants will be in the middle of the nBUG/YUEG Venn diagram).

The meeting will take place in the Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of Huddersfield, in the Joseph Priestley building South, room JPSG/18 (ground floor, room number 18). The university campus is located within a 10 min walk from the Huddersfield train station on the TransPennine Railway line. We already have two excellent speakers of the day, but the details of their talks will be announced later.

# Speakers

[Dr Marina Soares Da Silva](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/find-a-researcher/marina-soares-da-silva) is a postdoctoral researcher in the [Ancient Genomics Group](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/pontus-skoglund) at The Crick, where she develops interdisciplinary research at the intersection of genetics, archaeology and history. She uses ancient DNA recovered from skeletal remains from diverse archaeological contexts to study the genetics of past human populations in Britain.

Dr George Foody is a Senior Bioinformatician at the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk), where he is responsible for  developing pipelines and processes procedures for data transformation, quality control and delivery for large-scale -omic datasets. He mainly works with genomics files for the ~500,000 participants, which includes overcoming challenges of working at such a large scale as this comprises the majority of UK Biobank's 30Pb.
