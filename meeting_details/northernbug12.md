# General

We are thrilled to announce next NorthernBUG meeting which will be held on June 28th at the Centre for Life in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The Centre For Life is about 4 minutes walk from Newcastle Central Station.

The meeting will include a talk from Dr Simon Cockell: 'Putting the "space" into spatial transcriptomics: Lessons from computational geography' and an optional morning Workshop: 'From tissue to FASTQ: Understanding core technologies for spatial transcriptomics'.

Call for Speakers and Poster Presentations: We invite you to contribute to the success of this event by submitting your abstracts for talks and poster presentations. We are friendly group and this will be an excellent opportunity to get feedback from other bioinformaticians about your research. We particularly welcome abstracts from people wishing to talk about real world bioinformatics issues, help problem solving with a project, or from those looking for feedback at the early stage of a project.

Prizes: To recognize exceptional contributions, we will award £100 for the best talk and the best poster presentations. Your expertise could not only enlighten fellow attendees but also earn you a prize!

Limited Spaces: Please note that spaces for this event are limited. Priority will be given to presenters and those who present or register early. Don't miss out on the chance to be a part of this enriching experience.
