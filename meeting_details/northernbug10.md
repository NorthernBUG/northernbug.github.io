# General

The organising committee for NorthernBUG10 is: Andrew Mason, Sarah Forrester, Richard Gawne, Sally James and Alastair Droop. Emails should be directed to Andrew at andrew.mason@york.ac.uk

The meeting will take place on 1st September in **The Guildhall in York**. The building is located within a 10 min walk from York railway station (saving you a long walk or bus to the actual university campus).

# Agenda

We have now filled the agenda for the day - we had a lot of interest and it's great to highlight such diverse research (talks and posters!). We decided to go for 10 minute talks based on requests of attendees and wanting to fit as many in as possible. Posters and talks will be judged by the NorthernBUG steering committee and attendees, with prizes awarded for the top scoring.
Information and workshop materials for the [Git training session are available here](https://github.com/alastair-droop/northernbug10-git-workshop).

If you have a suggestion you'd like us (or organisers of the next meeting) to take on board, let us know!

# What to expect

NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research. Meetings are free, and lunch is provided!

These meetings focus on being a user group for the benefit of all. Talks and posters do not have to be a polished and complete body of work, but can be an opportunity to discuss your research with others experienced in the area. There is always a friendly atmosphere, with discussions around techniques, training and education, as well as broader applied research areas. 

As well as our core funding from [The Genetics Society](https://genetics.org.uk/), we have also received sponsorship from [York Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.york.ac.uk/biomedical-research-institute/), [Novogene](https://www.novogene.com/us-en/), [Source BioScience](https://sourcebioscience.com/), [10x Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/), [Oxford Nanopore Technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/) and [Visfo](https://www.visfo.health/). These will have stalls on the day, so there is an opportunity to hear about new technologies, promotional sequencing offers, and the potential for jobs in industry. Thank you to all our sponsors!

Sponsorship also means we have more funds for poster and talk prizes, and we are able to offer a small number of bursaries to help with costs for those with caring responsibilities, following The Genetics Society [Carer's Award](https://genetics.org.uk/grants/carers-award/). Please contact Andrew for further details.

# Registration

Registration has now closed. If you can no longer attend, it would be very helpful if you could let us know before the day.
