# What to expect

NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research. Meetings are free, and lunch is provided!

These meetings focus on being a user group for the benefit of all. Talks and posters do not have to be a polished and complete body of work, but can be an opportunity to discuss your research with others experienced in the area. There is always a friendly atmosphere, with discussions around techniques, training and education, as well as broader applied research areas. 

As well as our core funding from [The Genetics Society](https://genetics.org.uk/), we have also received sponsorship from [York Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.york.ac.uk/biomedical-research-institute/), [Novogene](https://www.novogene.com/us-en/), [Source BioScience](https://sourcebioscience.com/), [10x Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/), [Oxford Nanopore Technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/) and [Visfo](https://www.visfo.health/). These will have stalls on the day, so there is an opportunity to hear about new technologies, promotional sequencing offers, and the potential for jobs in industry. Thank you to all our sponsors!

Sponsorship also means we have more funds for poster and talk prizes, and we are able to offer a small number of bursaries to help with costs for those with caring responsibilities, following The Genetics Society [Carer's Award](https://genetics.org.uk/grants/carers-award/). Please contact Andrew for further details.

# Registration

Please [register using this Google Form](https://forms.gle/JnxeNpx3My2tKaqC9) by **Thursday 10th August**. This gives us enough time to confirm numbers for catering (very important!)

Also use the registration form to submit an abstract for a talk or a poster (same deadline). If you would like to do both(!), please submit an abstract for a talk, and then email Andrew directly (andrew.mason@york.ac.uk). You can select your preference for a talk length. If selected, we will do our best to accommodate. 

Posters and talks will be judged by the NorthernBUG steering committee and attendees, with prizes awarded for the top scoring.
