# What to expect

NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research. Meetings are free, and the host institution covers costs. Lunch is provided!

We've now selected talks and posters from submitted abstracts to finalise the agenda, but you can still register to attend.

Selected talks will be 15 mins with 5 mins of questions. Posters and talks will be judged and prizes will be awarded for the top scoring.
